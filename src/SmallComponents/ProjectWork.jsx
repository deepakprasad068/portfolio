              The Hunt" is a first-person shooter game developed in Unity where
              players must destroy robots spawned from a magical door and
              automatic fire-machines. The game features various weapons with
              unique abilities, such as ranged, explosive, and energy-based
              weapons. Players must fight off waves of enemies, using different
              tactics and weapons to survive. The levels become progressively
              harder, and the magical door continuously spawns new robots. The
              player must defeat all enemies to clear level while avoiding
              attacks from automatic fire-machines.

              designed for local multiplayer. Players can engage in a two-player

              vertically, or diagonally. The game features a simple and
              intuitive interface, making it easy for players to jump in and
